REDUX - state management library specifically designed for React applications.
ACTION CREATOR - the purpose of an action creator is to return an action,
      that will be sent to all the different reducers inside of our application
      , which then produce new value for state and updates that state inside of our Redux Store
ACTION - are plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened in the application.
      They are the only way to change the state in Redux.
      Each action must have a type property and can optionally include a payload
REDUCERS - are pure functions that take the current state and an action as arguments and return a new state.
      They specify how the state should change in response to an action
STORE - The store is the central repository that holds the state of the entire application.
      It acts as a single source of truth, making it easier to manage and maintain the state.
REDUX THUNK - allow us to create action creators that break the rules of regular redux.
      Specifically, it breaks the rule that we need to immediately return an action from every action creator we create.

Advantages of React Redux

1. Centralized State Management: The state is stored globally in the store, making it accessible to all
      components and simplifying state management
2. Performance Optimization: React Redux helps in improving performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders
3. Pure Reducer Functions: Reducers are pure functions, ensuring consistent and predictable state updates
4. Long-term Data Storage: Redux is suitable for storing long-term data that persists until the page is refreshed
5. Supportive Community: Redux has a large community, making it easier to learn best practices and get help when needed
